# GPU Ring Buffer Optimization for Audio Visualization

You should definitely try it - this is likely your biggest performance bottleneck right now. Here's a practical approach to get you started:

## Quick Implementation Strategy

### 1. Create a Large GPU Texture
Like 4-8 seconds of audio:

```python
# In CuPy/OpenGL setup
ring_buffer_size = 44100 * 4  # 4 seconds
ring_texture = create_texture_1d(ring_buffer_size, GL_R32F)
```

### 2. Upload Only New Chunks Each Frame
Instead of uploading entire current window:

```python
new_samples_per_frame = int(44100 / target_fps)  # ~441 at 100fps
glTexSubImage1D(GL_TEXTURE_1D, 0, write_head % ring_buffer_size, 
                new_samples_per_frame, GL_RED, GL_FLOAT, new_audio_chunk)
```

### 3. Let GPU Handle the Windowing
Shader reads from ring buffer:

```glsl
int sample_index = (write_head - lookback_samples + i) % RING_BUFFER_SIZE;
float sample = texelFetch(ring_buffer, sample_index, 0).r;
```

## The Payoff
You go from uploading ~2-4KB every frame to maybe 200-400 bytes. That's a **10-20x reduction** in memory bandwidth.

## Pro Tip
Start with a simple test - just render the ring buffer as a scrolling waveform to verify the indexing works correctly before adding FFT/frequency analysis back in.

This single change could easily double or triple your frame rate. The logic overhead is negligible compared to the memory bandwidth you'll save. Worth spending an hour to implement and test!
