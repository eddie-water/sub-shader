These scripts follow the course Analyzing Neural Time Series (ANTS) by Mike X 
Cohen. It has some useful material on the implementation of the low level 
aspects of modern time-frequency analysis techniques, such as the Fourier 
Transform and the Wavelet Transform. The scripts follow along selected lessons 
and replicate the Matlab code in Python.
