These scripts follow the course GPU Acceleration Basics by Rounak Paul. It 
demonstrates how to replicate CPU-bound array operations on the GPU. Basic
usage of the CuPy and Numba / CUDA libraries. Was able to time and calculate
the general speed up, and talked a little bit on GPU memory.Also the first time 
I've ever really used a Python notebook. The integrated magic timing is super 
useful!
