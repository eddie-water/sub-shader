The items in here don't really have a central theme. They are just kind of 
the random thoughts and partially unfinished or unexplored ideas that come into 
my head as I'm developing this project. Some work, some are from chat gpt,
some claude, random examples I find on the internet. Some have things I may 
eventually get to looking into but probably won't unless something problematic
occurs.
